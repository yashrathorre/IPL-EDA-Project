# IPL-EDA-Project
Exploratory Data Analysis project on IPL dataset using Python, pandas, and matplotlib.

# IPL Data Analysis Project

This project explores the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset using Python. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover insights about team performance, match trends, stadium stats, and more.

---

## 📁 Project Contents

- **proj1.py** – Python script containing all the analysis and visualizations
- **matches.csv** – Match-level data
- **deliveries.csv** – Ball-by-ball data

---

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess IPL match and delivery datasets
- Analyze team wins, matches played, and winning percentages
- Study stadium-wise match distribution
- Investigate toss impact on match outcomes
- Analyze scoring trends and average runs per season

---

## 📊 Highlights of the Analysis

### ✅ Team Performance
- Bar plots for **total matches played**, **total wins**, and **winning percentage** for each team.

### ✅ Stadium Analysis
- Stadium-wise match count showing which venues hosted the most games.

### ✅ Toss vs. Match Result
- Analysis of how often the toss-winning team ends up winning the match.
- Season-wise toss impact and team-wise toss win effectiveness.

### ✅ Scoring Patterns
- Calculation of **average runs per match** for each IPL season using merged match and delivery data.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning (missing values, inconsistent names)
- Data Merging (`matches` + `deliveries`)
- Feature Engineering (`toss_effect`, `average_runs_per_match`)
- Visualization and Storytelling

---

## 📌 Sample Visualizations

> *(Bar charts with rotated x-axis for readability, using Seaborn + Matplotlib)*  
- Winning percentages  
- Toss effect over seasons  
- Stadium distribution  
- Average runs per season

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add player-level performance analysis (top batsmen, bowlers)
- Create interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit
- Develop predictive models for match outcomes

---

## 📂 Dataset Source

- `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` (commonly found on Kaggle or public IPL datasets)

### 📢 Feedback is Welcome!

This project represents an early step in my data analysis journey. I’m always open to feedback or suggestions to improve the quality and depth of the analysis.
